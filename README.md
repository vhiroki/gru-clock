# GRU Clock

A friend of mine, Bruno Orlandi (@BrOrlandi), asked me to publish this experiment I made some years ago. So there it is...

In 2014, I was going for a trip and I had to take a flight on GRU Airport in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. At the boarding hall, while I was waiting to board the flight, I saw a beautiful animated clock displayed on a TV screen. Some pictures of it:
