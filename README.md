# GRU Clock

A friend of mine, Bruno Orlandi (@BrOrlandi), asked me to publish this experiment I made some years ago. So there it is...

In 2014, I was going for a trip and I had to take a flight on GRU Airport in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. At the boarding hall, while I was waiting to board the flight, I saw a beautiful animated clock displayed on a TV screen. 

Some pictures of it:

It seemed to be part of the airport's internal TV media. That bluish style was being used in all other contents and I liked it.

After returning from the trip, I decided to write it in Javascript using SVG.js lib (http://svgjs.com/). 

See the result: http://vhiroki.github.io/gru-airport

## Contributing

This is written in ES5 and it was a long time ago. I was learning Javascript, so that's not that easy to understand the code. Maybe I'll rewrite it in ES6 someday.

So, if you really want to use it for something, think hard about rewriting.
